# SteamDataProject

This is a project to try to do some statistical analysis on steam to try to predict which genres would sell more in the near future.


# TO-DO

- Do linear regression for a first model

- Investigate how the linear regression model can be improved

- Check if we can do some neural network to improve the estimation

- Test if having the "indie" label cause any statistical significance.

- Write my own data scrapper.
