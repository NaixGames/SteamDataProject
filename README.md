# SteamDataProject

This is a project to try to do some statistical analysis on steam to try to predict which genres would sell more in the near future.

# Data

Raw data was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/top-1000-steam-games/discussion/534302. 


# TO-DO

- Clean the data to avoid games that have demo / Playtest in the name. Clean games with too little players.

- Explain the process I used to clean the data (DO THIS FIRST!)

- Explain the things I did for data normalization

- Do linear regression for a first model

- Investigate how the linear regression model can be improved

- Check if we can do some neural network to improve the estimation

- Test if having the "indie" label cause any statistical significance.

- Test if having MAc support cause any statistical significance lmao.

- Write my own data scrapper.
